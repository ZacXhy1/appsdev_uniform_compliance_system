/* ==========================================================================
   Mock data — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for simulated detections.
   Dashboard, Live Monitoring, Detections, Violations, and Reports should
   all read from MOCK_DETECTIONS (and derive stats from it) rather than
   hardcoding their own numbers. No backend — this is a static array that
   simulates what a real detection pipeline would produce.

   SCOPE (important — do not expand without checking with the team):
   - The system only detects whether a person is wearing "School Uniform"
     as a single category. It does NOT distinguish blouse vs. polo,
     pants vs. skirt, or any other sub-type — a detection is simply
     'compliant' (in school uniform) or 'violation' (not in school
     uniform).
   - No ID lace detection. No footwear detection.
   - No student identification of any kind — there is no way for a
     camera to know who someone is, so records use a generic on-screen
     label ("Student 1", "Student 2", ...) rather than a real name or
     student number. Treat these as anonymous, unlinked detection
     events, not student records.
   - Single camera, fixed location: Main Gate. There is only ever one
     checkpoint in this simulation, so records do NOT carry a `location`
     field — don't add one, and don't build location filters/dropdowns
     on Live Monitoring, Detections, Reports, etc. If the project scope
     later adds more cameras, this is the file to revisit.

   Loaded as a plain script (no ES modules) so pages can open via
   file:// or a simple static server without CORS issues. Everything is
   attached to `window` so any page script can read it after this file
   loads first.

   Session-persisted detection log.

   A plain in-memory array resets every time the browser loads a new
   page — that's normal for a multi-page site with no backend, but it
   means anything Live Monitoring "detects" would vanish the moment you
   navigate away, and Detections would never see it. sessionStorage
   fixes that: it survives navigation within the same tab, but clears
   when the tab closes — exactly "persist for this session, not
   forever."

   getSessionDetections() is what every page should read from now
   (Live Monitoring, Detections, and eventually Dashboard/Violations/
   Reports) instead of the raw MOCK_DETECTIONS array, so a detection
   generated on one page is immediately visible on every other page
   too, for the rest of that browser session.
